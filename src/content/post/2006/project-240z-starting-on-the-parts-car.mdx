I got started on the parts car this week, a 78 280Z 2+2.

Yesterday I put in about an hour's work in on the car, it may not seem like much, but between that hour and the hour I spent on Sunday, that's 2 hours this week, prior to this week I hadn't put more than 2 minutes in over two months.

So yesterday I started disassembling the 280Z. In an hour I got the bumper and parts of the front body work off the car. Hopefully some of those parts will be reusable on the 240Z unless I find something else to do for front end body work on the Project 240Z.

Check out the video from the work yesterday!
