Andy took the 350Z out to <A href="https://www.tuxedoparkracing.com/">Tuxedo Park Racing</A> today to put her on the dyno and get a baseline for performance. Will post results of the dyno tonight!
 
Why do we need a baseline? Well we're hoping to see some improvement from the Nismo Ypipe and custom 3" exhaust we'll be putting on later this week. Also need to do a few other things before the DC pro, such as possibly new plugs and wires, and of course an oil change.
