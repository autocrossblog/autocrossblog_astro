Project 240Z Engine is almost ready to pull! I got the driveshaft disconnected today and the transmission is free of its mount. I just have a few things left to do, mainly hook the hoist up to the motor so I can pull the whole assembly free. To do that though I need to go buy a new change. The chain I've got now, from Krek, has some huge hooks on it, but the L24 motor doesn't have a good place for a hook on the rear.  
  
So this afternoon I'm going to head out and get some more chain, bolts, buts and washers to hopefully get the job done tomorrow. I'm also going to take a look at Autozone for a car cover for the 78. I need to get that covered to keep the birds/sap from killing it. I spent 30 minutes today cleaning it with mcguires cleaning wax to get all the bird crap off the hood. Also, once I have the motor out of the 240 I'll need to roll it into the driveway so I can get started on the 78. I'll definitely need to cover the 240 though, as it doesn't have all the body work and I need not upset the neighbors!
