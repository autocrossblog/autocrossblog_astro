Andy's got the Z for the weekend. He's off to a Test and Tune to try to figure out if we can work around the "flaws" that the Z has. He's having a special guest driver come in to help with the tuning of the car. He's got 4 front sway bars, new Hawk HPS pads, and 4 new 710s to play with.
 
Here's to hoping he can figure out our ice mode issues!
