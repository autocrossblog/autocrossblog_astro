I got a few details from Andy on his way back from the test and tune he took the car to this weekend at Grissom.
 
I'll try to do a full writeup later in the week, but the basics of what all has changed include.
 
Hawk HPS pads up front instead of HP+, which apparently solves our Ice Mode problems.
 
Run a full tank of gas, instead of completely empty, to help solve some of the corner exit tire spin issues we've been fighting for over a year.
 
A very special thanks to Sam Strano from <A href="https://www.stranoparts.com">www.stranoparts.com</A> for driving to Indiana to help Andy get the car squared away!
