In a few short hours we'll be departing St. Louis for our first autocross of the season. Well, it'll be my first autocross, Andy (my codriver) already has a few events under his belt! He's an Evolution instructor, so he's had the luxury of getting plenty of seat time already this year.
 
We're headding to Walnut Ridge this afternoon to be ready for the practice event tomorrow morning, I hope to use it to get all the rust out of my system prior to Saturday and Sunday's runs. The car is all ready to go, trailer is packed with the most tires I've ever taken. We've got 12 tires loaded up ready for Walnut Ridge's rough surface. One set of older tires to use during the practice. One set of Hoosier Rain tires just in case, and our competition set of tires mounted on Enkie RPF-1s.
 
B-Stock has a strong field in Walnut Ridge, we'll see how Andy and I fair!
 
More blogging this weekend with results!
