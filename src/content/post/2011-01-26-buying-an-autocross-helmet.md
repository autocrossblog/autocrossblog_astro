If you're looking to buy an [Autocross Helmet](https://soloperformance.com/collections/helmets-and-accessories) you should check out [SoloPerformance.com](https://www.soloperformance.com)

I've been a long time Solo Performance customer, and just recently purchased a number of items from them, including this stylish new [autocross helmet](https://soloperformance.com/collections/helmets-and-accessories)!

It should see its first autocross action this Sunday, though it has already seen action at the foosball table here at the office.
