description: Join me in my thrilling day at the St. Louis Region SCCA Solo Series Event 7 with car troubles, a heating race and more, !!

So I got up bright and early this morning, well it wasn't bright, the sun wasn't up yet. Headed out to Gateway Raceway in Madison Illinois for Event 7 of the St. Louis Region SCCA Solo Series. My parents came out in their large 
RV so I wanted to get out there early and be sure to get them a spot to park it.

After getting worker assignments squared away I took the car over and got it teched. All went well in tech and then Whittle came over and started messing around with the megasquirt. By the time the second heat came around, the heat in which I was running, it was getting rather warm out.

More on this post coming tomorrow as I updated it, short notes until then:

Car starts, car ran, car dies, and it's all vanity

Two quick photos, a lot more still uploading

And part of the reason the motor no longer runs, it doesn't appear to even turn over.
