So this won't be the final post here on Project240z.com, but we are likely coming close to the end. This weekend the car sold, an airman from the local Air Force base in Denver came by and gave me a deposit for the car. I'm going to try to get the title cleaned up this week and hopefully get it to him this weekend if he comes up with the rest of the money.

I'll post again when the car is gone. Thanks for all the interest in the car lately, unfortunately 99% of the interest came after I sold the car, not before, but oh well. For now check out my new toy, [https://www.project350z.com/](/category/350z/)
