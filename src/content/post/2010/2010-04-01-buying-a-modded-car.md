Don't do it! Unless you buy it from a friend and know exactly what they did!

When I purchased the 2nd Project350z, I purchased it just north of Denver Colorado from a Lexus dealer if I recall correctly.

The car had been modified, at the time of purchase I was unaware of what modifications has been made to it.

I then moved to California, and these modifications caused me signficant headache.

The catalytic converters had been replaced, which in most states probably wouldn't have been a problem, but in California most definitely was.

It also had a nice carbon fiber front lip, but when I started competing the car with SCCA I had to remove it due to it being illegal for the class I was running. 

The front bumper Z logo had been replaced, unsure why.
