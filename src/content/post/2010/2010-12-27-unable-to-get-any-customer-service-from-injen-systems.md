So I've been trying for 4+ months now to get some customer service from Injen Systems for the Super SES Exhaust on my Nissan 350z that has a massive leak in it.

Back in August I received a response from Injen

<blockquote>  
    Hi Chris,
    Can you send me a picture of your exhaust? I guess we had a few different ones made for that same vehicle and a photo would make it much easier to figure out what part and get you the correct part.
    <strong><b>Thank You,</b></strong>
</blockquote>  

I responded with photos of the exhaust and what I needed. I have heard nothing back. I've emailed them multiple times, even emailing their tech and info email addresses, but so far I have not received a single response from them since that email quoted above.

I sure wish I could get some help, I actually liked the exhaust on my 350z, but this has to be the worst customer service ever!


**UPDATE:** [I'm glad to say that Injen came through and got me the replacement parts I needed](injen-customer-service-update-it-rocks)!
