title: "Injen Exhaust for a 350z, Still Leaking"
---

So I still have an exhaust leak in the Injen Super SES System on my 2004 Nissan 350z. And I must say, I'm not too happy about it. [I blogged about this over a month ago](/ingen-super-ses-exhaust-leak-on-nissan-350z), almost two months now. I actually emailed Injen at the time, and I got a fairly quick response inquiring about photos of the system so they could try to figure out what replacement parts I need.

Since then there has been radio silence. I emailed them the photos, I've emailed them since, and have heard nothing back. At this point in time I'm going to have to suggest, if you're serious about your ride, stay away from Injen Systems. For cold air intakes, exhaust systems, whatever they sell. If this is the customer service they provide I can't suggest that anyone ever buys a product from them.
