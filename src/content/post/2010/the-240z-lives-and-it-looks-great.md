So it's been a while since I've blogged here on Project240z.com, reason being that I sold the car quite a while ago. Back this summer I got an email from a guy telling me he was the new owner, having purchased it from the guy that I sold it to.

Then, a couple weeks ago I got these in my inbox:

I cried a little bit. The car looks great, it has a motor in it, and it even has license plates! 

I'm glad he sent them to be, but it definitely makes me sad, to see the car up and running, all one color, I had it 4 years and never had it looking that good! Great work, I hope to hear more about the car in the future.

I'm still debating what is going on with the 350z, one day I want to trade it and get an EVO or STI, other days I want to keep it and put a turbo on it. We'll see, for now I imagine it will stick around because we've got a lot of other things going on and the budget doesn't necessarily allow for a turbo AWD right now.
