The time has come to revive the Project 350z. We are currently in the market for another car, (or V1 of Project350z if @Dozzle will sell it back).

Looking for a lower mileage car, manual transmission, preferably an Enthusiast model, but wouldn't be opposed to a Base this time around.

The more local to St. Louis the better.
