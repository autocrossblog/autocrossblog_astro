## Last Week's Progress with Dad and Today's Motor Work

### Oil Pan:
- **Cleaning and Painting**: Cleaned and painted the oil pan from the L28ET motor, attached with a new gasket.
- **Oil Pickup**: Switched from L28ET to L28E to fit the turbo pan properly.

### Exhaust and Manifold:
- **Painting**: Painted the exhaust manifold and turbo downpipe, though I'm aware the high temperatures might wear the paint off quickly.

### Valve Cover:
- **Touch-up**: Repainted the turbo valve cover to cover chips; considering powder coating in the future.

### Motor Inspection:
- **Observations**: Noted a different coloration inside the motor compared to another. Considering factors such as age or mileage differences. Thoughts?
