So I finally had it with listening to my Motorola Droid (Google Music and Pandora) for my commute. Why don't I have a stereo? Well back in February I ripped it all out. Not exactly the best choice, but hey, I was in the heat of the moment thinking I was prepping the car for a fully competitive 2011 season. That has changed, (more on that later).

A couple of weeks ago I told the subwoofer and amplifier for the car, I wasn't interested in putting all of that weight back in anyways. So tonight after work I put the speakers back in the door (with some cutting and soldering on the OEM wiring due to not having adapters for it.

I managed to get everything back into the front of the car, including the crossovers, and the head unit. I wasn't able to get the radio working, as it doesn't seem to see that the Antenna is hooked up, so I'll have to track that down. I also didn't get the rear speakers in, simply due to time/darkness, I'll get those later this week.

So, why am I not building the car fully for 2011? Well honestly, budget. I need to put quite a bit more money into the car, and it's already the middle of June. Where did time go? So, without the budget to fully prep the car, I'm going to drive something else at the 2011 Solo Nationals.

I'll be driving Dave Whitworth's Mustang in EM at Nationals. Dave and I have been friends for 11 years now, he was my first instructor when I started autocrossing, and while I surpassed him in autocross skills long ago, he's still a friend of mine. (Update 8/16/2024: I'm driving with Dave again this year, and I've yet to beat him....)

I'll fly into Lincoln, though I'm not sure when yet, and likely be there all week. I've offered to announce at the ProSolo Finale, though I haven't heard if anyone is interested in taking me up on that offer or not. 

I am hoping that for 2012 I can get the 350z sorted out and ready for Nationals. Though, I really don't like that I now live 26 hours from Nationals. Living in St. Louis and being a 5 hour drive from it (when it was in Topeka) definitely spoiled me!
