The 240Z once again stands on its own! Eric and I put the brakes back together on the car, put the wheels on and roll her out into the driveway. Spun her around, and rolled her back in. Then we procede to begin on the fuel cell installation (read cut shit out). Tonight I'll be working with Dave and Eric to cut more, and start fabricating the mounts for the Fuel Cell which I hope to have mounted by the end of the week!
