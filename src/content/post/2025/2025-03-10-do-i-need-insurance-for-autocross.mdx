A common question, or perhaps misconception:

## Does regular auto insurance cover accidents at an autocross event?

No!

## Longe3 explanation of autocross insurance options

Most auto insurance policies have limits as to what they will cover, and many, if not all, specifically state that they do not covered timed competitions or events held on a track. Read your policy some time, you won't like what you find.

Some local "time trial" events even claim you NEED to have automobile insurance to participate in their events, but good luck with getting that coverage enacted after something bad happens.

You might think you're covered, and then something terrible happens and you're up a creek.

You will want to look into autocross specific insurance, and as of this writing, I know of only one place that offers that. Lockton. 

[Lockton offers off track and autocross coverage](https://autocross.locktonmotorsports.com/)

They also offer parts/spare wheels coverage and trailer coverage, and even off track coverage for non street cars.

I was able to get my 2016 Scion FRS covered for $270 total for the entire 2025 season of autocross, that covers all autox events and multiple drivers!

This is NOT street coverage, you still need to have your regular automobile policy to cover street driven cars.

## What about the insurance that events take out?
Most events provide coverage that covers the organization from a medical perspective, not physical damage.

## What happens if I wreck my car at an autocross event?
You better hope you have Lockton Off-Track + Autocross coverage 

## What happens if my codriver wrecks my car at an autocross event?
Hopefully you have the autocross coverage, otherwise you may need to take your friend to court if they don't pony up the money to pay for hte damage (or loss of the vehicle).

## Can I add coverage to my normal automobile insurance policy?
Not likely, and honestly, I would be very wary of asking my insurance agent (unless they were close friends) about coverage at a track event, that'll race some flags.
