In today's blog post I am featuring a video I put together after my final autocross last fall.

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="hw-k3OZStn0" title="Autocross Analysis of 9-15-2024 Corvette Z06 Runs 2 Drivers" publishDate="2007-07-21T00:30:00+00:00" description="A different take on autocross videos, comparing runs by two different drivers in the same car, at the same event. Chris H. vs Chris L. at the St. Charles Family Arena on September 15, 2024" />

Chris Lybarger invited me to drive his Corvette Z06 in A-Street with him at a September autocross here in St. Louis. This was the first time I had competed in a C6 Corvette at an autocross, so I was excited for the opportunity. 

After the event I did something I haven't done previously, I put the two best runs together and compared them with video commentary of each run.
