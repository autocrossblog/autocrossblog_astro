About 1700 miles later I am home. It was a long 4-5 days, starting off early Thursday morning. I knew Dave and Beth were heading out as well, but didn't plan to follow along with them. I wanted to get on the road early so that I could swing through Lynchburg Tennesee to stop by the Jack Daniels Distillery there, [a must stop for me whenever possible](https://www.collectorofjack.com).

I made pretty good time, and gas mileage, to Lynchburg. The first ~30 miles, from my house to the Arch, I managed to get 40mpg in the 2016 FR-S. Most of the drive down on Thursday I didn't push it, the car really seems to get better mileage between 60-70mph than 70-80mph. 

A quick stop in Lynchburg to stock up on a few things for my [Collector of Jack hobby](https://www.collectorofjack.com) and I was once again on my way towards Moultrie Georgia. Besides Atlanta just being a hell of a place you never want to drive through, the trip was good. I managed to get into the town of Berlin before Dave and Beth (they were dropping their trailer off at the event site) and tracked down our AirBNB for the weekend.
