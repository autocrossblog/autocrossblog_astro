In a bit of last minute prep for the upcoming Red Hills National Tour in Moultrie Georgia, I toook the FR-S over to Solo Performance for an alignment before the tornados moved through St. Louis on Friday.

In this post you'll find the photo of the alignment spec sheet, with both the before and after readings.

The alignment readings in use on the FR-S are pretty much the same readings that I used on the previous car as well:
