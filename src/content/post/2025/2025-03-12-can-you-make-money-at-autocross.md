If you've ever participated in an autocross event, you know that it's a thrilling and competitive motorsport that emphasizes driver skill over raw horsepower. But can you actually make money at autocross? The short answer: **yes, but not much, and most people won't!**.  

Unlike professional motorsports, autocross is fundamentally an amateur sport. The majority of participants are weekend warriors who race for fun, not financial gain. However, there are a few ways that dedicated and entrepreneurial autocross enthusiasts can turn their passion into profit.  

## **Why Autocross Isn‚Äôt a Money-Making Sport**  

### 1. **No Big Prize Purses**  
Unlike road racing, drag racing, or NASCAR, autocross events rarely offer cash prizes. The SCCA (Sports Car Club of America) Solo Nationals, the biggest autocross event in the U.S., doesn‚Äôt offer prize money‚Äîonly trophies and bragging rights (and a nice jacket if you win).  

### 2. **No Sponsorship Deals Like Pro Racing**  
Professional racers make money through sponsorships, but in autocross, sponsorships are minimal. Most companies that support autocross drivers do so with discounts on gear, tires, or entry fees rather than direct payments.  

### 3. **High Costs with No Return**  
Autocross isn't expensive compared to other motorsports, but it‚Äôs still a money pit rather than a money-maker. Costs include:  
- Entry fees ($40‚Äì$200 per event)  
- Tires (which wear out quickly)  
- Car maintenance and upgrades  
- Travel and lodging for national events  

So, if making money is your goal, autocross alone won‚Äôt get you there. However, there are **a few ways** to generate income related to autocross.  

## **How to Make Money in Autocross (Indirectly)**  

### **1. Coaching and Instruction**  
If you're an experienced autocross driver, you can offer coaching to newer drivers. Some people are willing to pay for in-car instruction, ride-alongs, or personalized feedback.  

- Local SCCA regions sometimes hire instructors for novice schools.  
- Private coaching can be offered at events or through online platforms like YouTube and Patreon.  

### **2. Content Creation (YouTube, Blogging, Social Media)**  
Autocross has a niche but dedicated audience online. If you can create high-quality content‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs instructional videos, in-car footage, car setup tips, or race recaps‚Äîyou might be able to monetize through:  

- **YouTube Ad Revenue** (once you hit the monetization threshold)  
- **Sponsorships** from racing gear brands, tire companies, or local shops  
- **Affiliate Marketing**, such as sharing links to helmets, cameras, or car parts  

### **3. Photography and Videography**  
Good action shots from autocross events are highly desirable. If you have photography or videography skills, you can:  

- Sell photos to drivers after events  
- Offer professional highlight videos for competitors  
- Work with local clubs to be their official photographer/videographer  

### **4. Car Setup and Tuning Services**  
Many autocrossers struggle with optimizing their car‚Äôs suspension, alignment, or tuning. If you‚Äôre skilled at setting up cars, you could offer services such as:  

- Tire consultation and alignment tuning  
- Shock/suspension setup  
- Data analysis (if you‚Äôre familiar with tools like SoloStorm or AIM data systems)  

### **5. Selling Used Race Parts**  
Buying and selling used autocross parts‚Äîlike wheels, tires, shocks, or sway bars‚Äîcan be a side hustle. Some autocrossers buy lightly used racing tires, use them for a few events, and then resell them before they‚Äôre completely worn out.  

### **6. Event Organization and Club Involvement**  
While volunteering at autocross events doesn‚Äôt typically pay, **some event organizers and club officials do receive compensation** in certain organizations. If you help grow a local autocross program, you might be able to take a small cut from event fees or sponsorships.  

### **7. Starting a Racing-Related Business**  
If you‚Äôre truly committed, you can create a small business around autocross, such as:  
- Selling custom race gear (shirts, hats, stickers)  
- Running an online store for niche racing products  
- Developing autocross-focused software or mobile apps  

## **Making Money in Autocross Through Contingency Programs**  

Many autocross drivers earn money (or at least cover some costs) through **contingency programs** offered by manufacturers and sponsors. These programs reward drivers for using specific brands and performing well in events.  

### **How Contingency Works**  
- A company (tire manufacturer, parts company, car brand) offers a rewards program.  
- You must **register** for the program before competing.  
- You typically need to **display decals** on your car and use the company‚Äôs product.  
- If you finish in a qualifying position, you can earn cash, product credits, or rebates.  

### **Contingency Programs That Pay in Autocross**  

#### **1. Tire Manufacturers**  
Tires are the biggest source of contingency money in autocross. Companies like:  
- **Bridgestone**  
- **Falken**  
- **Hoosier**  
- **BFGoodrich**  
- **Yokohama**  

offer payouts if you place well on their tires. Some programs only pay for national events, while others also cover regional competitions.  

üîπ **Example Payouts:**  
- **$100‚Äì$300 per win** at national-level events.  
- **Discounted or free tires** for repeated podium finishes.  

#### **2. Car Manufacturers**  
Some automakers offer contingency money for competing in their cars. In SCCA Solo, brands like:  
- **Mazda** (the biggest supporter, paying cash for wins)  
- **Toyota**  

pay drivers who place well in eligible cars.  

üîπ **Example:**  
- Mazda‚Äôs **Motorsports Contingency Program** can pay up to **$800 for a national win**.  

#### **3. Aftermarket Parts Companies**  
Some companies pay drivers for using their parts. Examples include:  
- **Hawk Performance** (brake pads)  
- **Eibach** (suspension)  
- **K&N Filters** (intakes)  

These payouts are usually **product credits** rather than cash.  

#### **4. SCCA Nationals and ProSolo Bonuses**  
The **SCCA National Solo and ProSolo series** offer contingency money from multiple brands. Winning at the **Solo Nationals** or **ProSolo Finale** can net **$500‚Äì$1,000 or more** in contingency payouts if you're signed up for multiple programs.  

## **Can You Actually Profit From Contingency?**  

**In theory, yes‚Äîbut realistically, it mostly helps cover expenses.**  

Let‚Äôs do some quick math for a **top-level driver** who wins multiple events:  

| **Expense / Earning** | **Amount** |  
|----------------------|------------|  
| Set of Hoosiers (2-4 events) | -$1,200 |  
| Travel (gas, hotels, food) | -$1,000 |  
| Event Entry Fees (3 national events) | -$600 |  
| **Contingency Winnings (2 wins, 1 podium)** | +$1,500 |  
| **Total:** | **-$1,300** |  

Even with contingency winnings, you‚Äôre still spending more than you earn unless you're consistently dominating major events. For most autocrossers, **contingency offsets costs rather than generating a true profit.**  

## **Final Takeaway: Yes, You Can Make Money, But‚Ä¶**  

Contingency programs **do provide real money in autocross**, but unless you‚Äôre winning at a national level, they won‚Äôt make autocross profitable. The best-case scenario is **breaking even**‚Äîand even then, you‚Äôll still need to cover travel and entry costs.  

That said, if you're fast, strategic about what brands you support, and consistently place well, **contingency money can be a valuable way to fund your racing habit.**
