Can you spot the problem in this photo?

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1464171009/"><img height="160" alt="Broken piston in a L28 motor" width="240" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1181/1464171009_5e23f11ac7_m.jpg" /></a> 

Status: Motor is once again out of the car, and I'm pretty confident it won't be going back into any car..... ever....

The photo is of the piston that decided to leave its brothers behind.
