So you're heading to your first Solo National Championships, it can be overwhelming, you've likely never experienced anything like you're going to see this week in Lincoln Nebraska, so I'm going to try to take some time to give you a heads up! Hopefully it will help you have an even more fun week!

## 1. One of the Largest Motorsport Events in the World

The Solo Nationals is one of the largest motorsport events globally, featuring nearly 1,300 competitors over four days. When you combine this with the ProSolo Finale and CAM Challenge beforehand, there will be nearly 7,000 competition runs. It's a massive event that brings together the best autocross drivers from across the nation, making it an experience like no other.

## 2. Course Walks Are Important

At Nationals, you'll have plenty of opportunities to walk the courses. You'll run two separate courses: the East and West, sometimes referred to as the "plane" and "corn" sides. The courses will be open for walking multiple times throughout the week, starting on Monday when no competition runs are happening. They are open all day Monday from around 10 am and then each morning from Tuesday to Friday before competition starts. Walking the course multiple times helps you familiarize yourself with the layout, visualize your driving lines, and plan your strategy for each run.

## 3. Social Activities

There are plenty of opportunities for social activities throughout the week of Nationals. Local regions often host cookouts, parties, and other gatherings around the paddock, creating a festive atmosphere. You'll find everything from big wheel races to margarita machines and beer trades scattered throughout the area. Whether you prefer to stay on-site for the festivities or explore Lincoln's local scene, there’s no shortage of ways to unwind and connect with fellow competitors and enthusiasts.

## 4. Getting Around Town in Lincoln

Lincoln, Nebraska, the host city for the Solo Nationals, is a vibrant college town with a variety of restaurants, bars, and local attractions to explore. The city is easy to navigate, with most amenities and popular spots located within a short drive from the event site. However, keep in mind that the Solo Nationals coincide with the University of Nebraska's football season, and there are games on the weekends that bookend the championship. This can lead to increased traffic and limited parking, especially downtown and near the stadium, so plan your trips accordingly.

## 5. Length of the Courses

One thing you will likely experience for the first time at Nationals is the length of the courses. These courses are typically over a minute long, which is quite different from the shorter courses most people encounter at local autocross events around the country. The extended length of the courses can be both exciting and challenging, providing more opportunities for mistakes but also allowing drivers to showcase their endurance and consistency.

## 6. Much Better Competition

The competition at Solo Nationals is often top-notch, bringing together the best drivers from all across the country in every class. This is where you'll find the elite competitors who excel in their local regions, making the challenge at Nationals significantly tougher. Don't be discouraged if you don't come out on top. Nationals is as much about learning and growing as a driver as it is about winning. Use this opportunity to gain experience, connect with fellow competitors, and make new friends.

## 7. Tire Service and Other Vendors

If you're coming to Nationals and need tire services such as mounting, balancing, or flipping, be sure to check out SPS and RS Racing, located near the front of the paddock. They provide excellent on-site services to help drivers with their tire needs throughout the event. In addition to tire services, there are several other vendors on site, including food vendors, coffee stands, and booths selling t-shirts and event merchandise. Be sure to visit them multiple times throughout the week to see what they are offering. Supporting them is a great way to contribute to the community and keep the event lively.

## 8. Paddock

The paddock at Solo Nationals is enormous, and it's likely unlike any event you've attended before in terms of size and the number of competition and support vehicles packed into one spot. The area is meticulously organized into laid-out rows and columns, so it’s important to pay attention to where you are assigned to park. Make sure not to encroach on someone else’s space, as every spot is accounted for. The paddock tends to get extremely crowded on Tuesday and Wednesday when competitors for Thursday and Friday arrive while those who competed earlier in the week may still be there. Be patient, be kind, and help people out.

## 9. Results and Announcements

Stay connected and informed throughout the event by using the Sportity app, which is an essential tool for the Solo Nationals. This app provides a wealth of useful information, including run time updates, important announcements, and links to results. It's the best way to stay up to date with what's happening on and off the course. By regularly checking the app, you'll ensure that you’re aware of any schedule changes, heat updates, or other critical information.

## 10. Results and Awards

In the past, results and awards at Solo Nationals were traditionally handed out at banquets on Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday nights. However, the format has changed, and now trophies are awarded directly in the grid after the competition ends for the day. It’s important to pay attention to when and where the awards are being given out. Even if you don't end up taking home a trophy, it's a great experience to stick around and cheer on your fellow competitors.
