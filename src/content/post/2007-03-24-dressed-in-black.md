Well the engine bay of the Project 240Z has a nice coat of black paint. I'll be touching up a few areas tomorrow, as well as doing the following.

Hitting the Junkyard to locate parts I still need for the megasquirt setup, including mostly these ford parts: throttlebody from a V8, VR Sensor from a V6, fuel injectors, wires, coils. 

I'll also be hitting the parts store for some new break and clutch lines, installing the clutch line, and hopefully starting to put the transmission onto the turbo motor.
