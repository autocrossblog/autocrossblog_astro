Well today a key component of my project arrived, the downpipe for the Turbo showed up. At first I flipped out thinking it was the wrong downpipe.

Then someone on Hybrid Z kindly pointed out that I need to remove the stock wastegate housing in order  to install this downpipe, which I believe is off a Z31 motor, instead of an L28ET motor like I have.

I'll be testing this out tomorrow, then I hope to try to get it over to Hackman to get it powder coated!
