Original Post:

Alright the time has come to part with the parts. I took some time this evening to take photographs of what I have and what I am trying to sell. Right now I am trying to sell everything locally so prices don't include any shipping. If I don't have any interest locally I'm willing to ship the coilovers/springs/shocks but only as a package.

Sway bars and the exhaust are way too much of a hassle to try to ship, so those are local only. (Local in the San Francisco Bay Area, if you're somewhere else in California and want to drive here, feel free).

**Cash Only, no checks. Paypal acceptable for a hold, but cash must be delivered in full before handover of the parts. All parts located in Half Moon Bay, contact me at z - at - christoc.com for more info.**

All parts are sold as is, with no warranty, and unknown mileage. I can tell you I put about 10k on each of them (except the control arms and the Cobb bar), but am not sure what they had prior to me.

I'm also still selling the 18x10" Enkei RPF1s over on my other post.

Everything needs a good cleaning, has your usual scrapes from a lowered vehicle, but overall in great shape. No clue on mileage of the other parts. Includes bolts (except for the catalytic converter side) and extra hanger arm to mount on the car, but no rubber hangers

## 350z Control Arm v2 from SPL Pro Suspension SOLD  

<strong>SOLD</strong> I didn't use these, they weren't legal for the class I was running, but I was told they are V2 arms, and that the ball joints needed replaced. You'll need a nut for the ball joint as well.
