So I loaded the car up on the trailer tonight after work (well, between work actually). I'm going to take it to a buddy's shop for a few days as we get the house packed up and everything loaded onto the moving (horse) trailer. Tuesday I'll go pickup the car and we'll hit the road for Colorado on Wednesday. 

I even drove it up on the trailer under its own power!
