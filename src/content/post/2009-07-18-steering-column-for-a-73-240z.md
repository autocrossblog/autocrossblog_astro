So just an FYI so others don't waste money like I did. The steering column off a 1978 280Z will NOT fit on a 1973 240Z. I contacted the ebay seller to check before hand and was assured it would, unfortunately upon reciept and attempt at putting it in the car it does not fit :(

I guess I'll just have to rig the bad 73 column for the haul to Colorado and look for another solution in the coming months. 

Lesson learned, don't trust ebay sellers to know what they are talking about.
