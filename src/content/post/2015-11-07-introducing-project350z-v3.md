Earlier this week, Dave from SoloPerformance.com and I headed down to Chattanooga to pick up Project350z V3. A 2003 Nissan 350z Touring model, with 145k miles on the clock. The car was purchased from a fellow autocrosser, and is primarily prepped for SCCA's STU class.

The car has a couple of issues, the first one I need to address is that the horn doesn't work. After digging into it, I found it is because it simply isn't wired up, a previous owner had replaced the stock wheel, and when the owner I purchased it from got it, he put the original stock wheel back on. The wiring was jacked at this point, and the cruise control and horn no longer connect/work. I've already placed an order for some parts to hopefully get those two items addressed this coming week so I can get it out for Missouri inspection so I can get it tagged.

I'll be doing some modifications over the winter to get it in line with the STU rules, and hopefully fully prepped to give it a competitive chance for 2016. 

This Sunday (11/8) I'll have the car out and running at the final Gateway Autocross Association event for 2015, see you out there!

Stay tuned as I dig into the car and get to actively blogging more as I get the work done on the car.
