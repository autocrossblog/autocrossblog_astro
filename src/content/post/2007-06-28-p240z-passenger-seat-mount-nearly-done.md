I spent another hour or so tonight working on the passenger seat mounts I hope to get some bolts tomorrow and attempt to mount the seat into the car tomorrow night or Friday.


I'm still waiting on my fuel rail from Lone Wolf Performance. I hope to hear from them tomorrow and have the part by Friday. If not I'll have to find myself another source for a fuel rail.


Goals for this weekend. Mount both seats in the car, though I'll pull them back out until I'm ready to leave them in there for a while, they are too nice to keep in such a dirty car till it gets cleaned up! I'm also shooting for getting the fuel cell all fabricated and mounted into the car, along with fuel lines run to the front of the car.
