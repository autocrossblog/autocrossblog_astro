So one of the ways to help supplement the cost of autocross at a National level with the SCCA is to participate in their contingency programs. There are a variety of contingency options available, depending on:
- What make of car you drive
- What class you run in
- What tires you run
- What programs you register for

You should check out the [SCCA Autocross Contingency page](https://www.scca.com/pages/solo-contingency) to see which options are available to you, and which will work for your particular class/car.

What's the catch with contingencies? Well, you typically (almost always) have to run your vehicle with the sponsors decals on the vehicle.

For SSC, here are the contingencies that I believe to be applicable:
- TRD â€“ ProSolo
- Falken Tire â€“ ProSolo & Champ/Match Tours
- Hawk Performance Brakes - ProSolo & Champ/Match Tours
- [Solo Performance Specialties](https://www.soloperformance.com/) â€“ Champ/Match Tours
- RaceChick.com â€“ ProSolo (ladies)

The amounts will all vary, but Falken for example will pay $300 for first, $200 for second and $100 for third.
