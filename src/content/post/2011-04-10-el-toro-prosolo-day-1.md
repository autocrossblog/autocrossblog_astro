I just don't have the energy to do a full writeup for the ProSolo today, and to be honest, it won't happen Sunday, and likely not Monday either <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile" alt="Open-mouthed smile" src="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/086ec53de232_13331/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile_2.png" />

So what happened? Well, I'm sitting in 5th out of 8, 2nd in the Kumho class. I'm still hoping to get up to first in the K Class <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/086ec53de232_13331/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" /> With the contingency available that would mean a set of tires.

Jodi Fordahl is driving with me as well. She's doing great, I have a feeling she'll be faster than me on Sunday.

Random note: This car really needs a diff!  I am going to try to find the OS Giken guys if they are at the Pro tomorrow and talk to them a bit.
