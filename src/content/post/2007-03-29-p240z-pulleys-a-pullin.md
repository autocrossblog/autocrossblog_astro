Well we overcame the the brake booster issues from last night. Dad got the Brakeline hooked up to the MC, and we got the booster installed in the firewall and hooked up to the pedal.

After that I got the proper tool and pulled the pulleys off the 78 motor and the 83 motor as well. Not likely to get any work done tomorrow as I have a meeting tomorrow night, but Dad took the radiator from the 78 to get it cleaned up and pressure checked at a shop tomorrow sometime.

At lunch I'll also hopefully be getting the 37pin plug for the Megasquirt put together.
