 The TireRack has announced that they have sold their 100th SSC kit! I have some insider knowledge that says they sold it before the Spring Nationals, but the announcement just came out today via the SoloMatters newsletter (hey look at that screenshot, [who is that](https://www.chrishammond.com/)?)!
 
If you haven't tried SSC out yet, you are missing out! This class is the future of Solo! 

Speaking of Spring Nationals, stay tuned for our write up, we're still trying to get caught up, but it should be up later this week!
