So what did you do this weekend? Did you spend two days under your car? I basically did, well more like 1 day, but it was broken up over an afternoon/evening and then the following morning after I ran to get a new "nut" that I needed to finish things up.

Why was I under the 350z? Well, removing the fun parts of course. I planned to remove the front and rear Hotchkis sway bars, along with the TrueChoice Phase 4 Konis (front) and the off the shelf Koni Sports (rear) along with springs/perches. Though in order to deal with the rear sway bar I also ended up pulling the Injen Super SES exhaust system off the car as well and put the OEM exhaust back on.

I of course time lapsed the whole affair, using my trusty [GoPro Camera HD HERO2 Motorsports Edition](https://amzn.to/3Qfjj8G). You can check out the video here on the page, and don't forget to subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/christoc?feature=watch)!
