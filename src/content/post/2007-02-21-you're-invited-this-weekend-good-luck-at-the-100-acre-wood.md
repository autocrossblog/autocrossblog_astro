Alright, this coming weekend is the time. I'm going to pull the motor out of the parts car this weekend, as well as the transmission, and any other parts I can salvage. If anyone is interested in helping out, I'll provide all the food and beer you desire while over here.
 
## What all do we have to do?
  
The parts car is a 1978 280Z 2+2. I need the transmission for the 240Z, and probably will end up needing the motor for when the Turbo motor has problems! 

Other than that, I want to remove whatever I can save/sell before I scrap the rest of it so I can bring the 240Z back home. 

Best of luck to the guys/girls that will be at the 100 Acre Wood. Muggy, bring home a win! Jim, keep the Rally truck together for her last ride!
