Alright, here's my goal, and I'm stating it here so I can hopefully hold myself accountable.

I want to bring the Datsun home from storage in May. In order to do that I need to make room in the garage, which means finding a place for the following

16 tires/wheels (headed to the basement)

Complete Datsun Suspension (disassemble and then take to basement)

Dispose of an automatic transmission for the Datsun

Dispose of a 5 Speed for the Datsun (someone is supposed to be picking it up tonight)

After making room I need to finish putting the motor together, which I should be able to do in a couple hours worth of work this week and coming weekend.

I'll post later this week with how I'm progressing.
