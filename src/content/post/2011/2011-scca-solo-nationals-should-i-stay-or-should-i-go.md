So here we are, at the end of May 2011, and it's time to figure out if I'm going to the 2011 Tire Rack SCCA Solo National Championships in late August.

Originally I was planning on taking the 350z, but lately I've been thinking that I probably won't/can't/shouldn't due to a number of factors, mainly budget, but time, and family. With a new baby, taking off to Lincoln Nebraska for a week (or more) is a rather costly affair. I can't exactly put Natalie and the baby in the 350z and make the drive, and making the drive with the 350z, towing a trailer for tires, and having Natalie and the baby drive in the CX-7 isn't ideal either.

So I have a couple of options. 
- Don't go (least expensive option, also least fun)
- Drive myself in the 350z, have Natalie and baby fly out (requires airline ticket, and rental car)
- Drive myself in the 350z and have Natalie and baby stay home
- Fly to Lincoln and codrive with someone else

What to do, what to do?
