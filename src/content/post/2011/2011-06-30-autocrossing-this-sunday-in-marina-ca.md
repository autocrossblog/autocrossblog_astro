Alright, it's time to get back into the swing of things. The 2011 TireRack SCCA Solo Nationals are in two months, I need to try to get as much seat time as I can between now and then!

This weekend the AmericanAuto-x Series is going on at Marina. I've yet to hit an AAS event, so I am looking forward to it. It will have been nearly three months since my last event, so I'm sure I'll be plenty rusty. I am only going to hit the Sunday event, not ready to do both Saturday and Sunday, as I have some work to do on the car, and also some work to do around the house on Saturday.

If you're going to be at Marina this weekend, be sure to come up and say hello.
