So I've wanted to do this for a while, and now I'm getting ready to pull the trigger.

I am going to wrap the 350z? What does that mean? I am going to take a solid Vinyl color, and wrap it around the entire painted surface of the car. Effectively changing the color of the car, and covering the paint in a protective vinyl coating.

<strong>Why am I wrapping the car?</strong> Because I can? Or well, because I want to. I don't know yet that I can. I've applied quite a bit of vinyl in my life, but never to an entire car.

<strong>Why not have someone else wrap it? Why not have a designer wrap done? </strong>Both of those options cost money, and I really would rather spend money elsewhere on the car. That being said, if you own a car wrapping business in the San Francisco Bay Area and you want to sponsor Project350z, fill out the Contact form on the About page. 

<strong>What color are you going to wrap it?</strong> That's where you come in. We've setup a "Poll" on our Facebook page, where you get to help us decide. The options are "Matte Black, Matte Green, Don't Do it!" If you have a Facebook account go ahead and answer the question! The Poll will stay open until 5/4/2011.

And while you are at it, don't forget to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/project350z" >"LIKE" our page</a>!
