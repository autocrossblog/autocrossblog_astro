So I ran around Redwood City today over lunch, I needed to find some spacers and lug nuts to go along with the new studs that arrived today from [Solo Performance Specialties](https://www.soloperformance.com)

I went to Kragen first, they didn't have any spacers but were kind enough to point me towards Five Point Tire in Redwood City. Five Point was great, service was awesome and the guy was very helpful. I picked up 6 spacers, with the intention of only using 2 or 4 of them for now.

When I got home I wanted to make sure that the lugs were going to work. They were Gorilla Lug nuts, designed to go through the holes in the wheels to help position them on the hub. Unfortunately when I test fitted them though the wheels they don't actually fit through the holes :)

Looks like I will need to run to Five Point Tire again Friday or Saturday and see what their options are. I will likely take a wheel with me this time to make sure things work out.
