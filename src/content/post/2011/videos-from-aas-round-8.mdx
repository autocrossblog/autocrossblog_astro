Here are the photos from the American Autocross Series Round 8 from 7/3/2011. The car is of course our 2004 Nissan 350z in half prep for B Street Prepared.

Unfortunately I don't have times, but let's see if I can recall the order of the runs.

Run 1 was the slowest, 2 was faster, as was 3. 4 Had a cone at the very finish (watch the rear camera) and run 5 was slower.

## Run 1
