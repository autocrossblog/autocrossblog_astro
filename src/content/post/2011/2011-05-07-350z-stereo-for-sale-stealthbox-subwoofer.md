I took all of this stuff out of my car a few months ago and am just now getting around to selling.

To the best of my knowledge here is what I have, you can find all the pictures from below (and more) at a higher resolution at [this Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157626520108688/with/5628927973/).

All equipment is used, but was in working order when removed from the car.

**Package Price**    
**$950 cash**

**Amplifiers**    
JL Audio 300/4    
JL Audio 500/1

**Speakers**    
JL Audio VR650CXi (pair)    
JL Audio VR650CWi (pair) (best I can find online is CSi? but my pic is clearly CWi) Tweeters are not removed from car, so not included.

**Subwoofer**    
JL Audio Stealthbox

**Head Unit**    
Pioneer deh-p860mp (also including the wiring/adapter for aux input, remote)

Wiring (see photo, lots of wiring included, power, ground, speaker wires, only thing cut was at the doors if I recall correctly)

Looking to sell as a package deal for $950/cash, local pickup only. Located in San Carlos CA.    
Everything is in working order as far as I know, worked fine when I removed it from the car.
