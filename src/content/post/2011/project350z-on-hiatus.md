So things have slowed down for the Project350z, at least for a month or two. After running quite a few events in February, March and April, I haven't run an event since the El Toro ProSolo on 4/10.

I plan to run more events this year, but life has put autocross to the side for a month or two. We're getting ready to move, so autocross has been the last thing on my mind.

This weekend there's the Dual at DeAnza, last year I was hoping to run this year's event, but due to everything going on I ended up not registering. It looks like Grant (ShamuZ) has lost his car for the event, due to losing a rear diff (He's got an OS Giken diff as far as I know, I need to find out what happened as that is the diff I was hoping to put in my car later this year). I've asked Grant to see if he can get me into his entry position for the Duel, if he can I will try to run the event.

If it doesn't work out, so be it, but I think it would be cool to run. The next few weeks are going to be extremely busy, so an autocross before all of that would be a good release!
