It will likely be a full weekend for me, lots of suspension work to do on the car. Though the biggest task might be making room in the garage so I can get the car inside! Typically when I'm working on the car I move a lot of stuff out to make room, but it is supposed to rain for the next 5-10 days, so I doubt I'll be able to move too much outside. I may have to move some things inside into my office for the interim.

I'll be glad when we have a larger house, and possibly a storage unit!
