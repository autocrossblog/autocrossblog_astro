I just don't have the energy to do a full writeup for the ProSolo today, and to be honest, it won't happen Sunday, and likely not Monday either.

So what happened? Well, I'm sitting in 5th out of 8, 2nd in the Kumho class. I'm still hoping to get up to first in the K Class! With the contingency available that would mean a set of tires.

Jodi Fordahl is driving with me as well. She's doing great, I have a feeling she'll be faster than me on Sunday.

Random note: This car really needs a diff!  I am going to try to find the OS Giken guys if they are at the Pro tomorrow and talk to them a bit.
