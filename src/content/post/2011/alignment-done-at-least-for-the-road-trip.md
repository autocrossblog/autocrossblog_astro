So I didn't figure I was going to have time to do the alignment on the 350z over the next couple of days, and I wasn't sure that I really wanted to do an alignment myself after just lowering the car. I mean, I want to do it, but driving down to San Diego on Thursday isn't the time I need to press my alignment skills.

So today I took the car to the local Firestone dealer to get an alignment done today. Here's what I told them.

"I want to know what the specs are, and I want the toe to be within factory specifications."

No problem they said, then they upsold me on the lifetime alignment. I told them, oh that won't work for me, I'm gonna be making lots of changes, you guys won't honor it. He assured me that they would, and even double checked with the manager. We'll see how it works out, but I'm hoping they will honor it going forward! Really I will just want to use them here or there to verify that what I do when I make adjustments and try to align it myself.

Less than an hour later I got a phone call saying that the car was ready to go. Here are the specs that I came away with.

|          | Left F/R (in degrees) | Right F/R(in degrees) |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Camber   | -2.3/-2.4             | -2.5/-2               |
| Toe      | .05/.12               | .07/.09               |

Friday I plan to do some adjustment to the Toe, getting some toe out in front and toe in in the rear. We'll see if I can get that adjustment squared away using my longacre toe plates.

If I come up with some additional settings for autocross alignment I'll create a new blog post for the specs.
