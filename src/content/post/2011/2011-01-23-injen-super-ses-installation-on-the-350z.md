If you followed the blog post earlier this week you already know that Injen came through and got me the replacement midpipes for my Super SES Exhaust which I removed late last year.

Today I took the OEM exhaust off the 350z and put the Injen exhaust back on. The job itself is easy, probably could do it all in about 25 minutes if I really pushed it, but I didn't. I took my time, cleaned up in the garage a bit, cleaned up the exhaust a bit as well. I also managed to weigh both the Injen exhaust and the OEM exhaust to see what the difference was. I was hoping it would be more!

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="613">      <tbody>          <tr>              <td valign="top" style="width: 225px;"><strong>Exhaust</strong></td>              <td valign="top" style="width: 386px;"><strong>Weight</strong></td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td valign="top" style="width: 225px;">OEM 350z Exhaust</td>              <td valign="top" style="width: 386px;">Y-pipe (15lbs) Midpipe (10lbs) Muffler (35lbs)         <br />              <strong>Total 60lbs</strong></td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td valign="top" style="width: 225px;">Injen Super SES Exhaust</td>              <td valign="top" style="width: 386px;">Midpipes (10lbs each) Muffler (15lbs each)         <br />              <strong>Total 50lbs</strong></td>          </tr>      </tbody>  </table>

*(these weights were taken on a standard bathroom scale, not sure of their accuracy)*

So installing the Super SES Exhaust should save me ~10lbs over the stock setup, providing more flow and hopefully more horse power. I had the car dyno'd back in April of 2010 with the original Super SES setup on it, I will have to find the dyno sheets but if I recall correctly it was around 259 to the rear wheels. Not bad considering I believe my first Z in stock form on a totally different dyno setup, did around 219 to the rear.

I setup my GoPro HD today to take a photo every 2 seconds while I was working, I think it turned out well, though a number of the shots are a little dark in the garage, I think I can fix that next time.

I also took a number of photos of the exhaust before putting it on.

The old and new mid pipes, you can see on the new one that there is extra reinforcement now to prevent the cracking that caused the leak on the original setup.
