Have you ever wanted to learn how to tune the suspension on a car?

Well, I haven't really wanted to know that, until recently. Now I NEED to know. I took the Evo Advantage program this past weekend at the San Diego National Tour and felt like a total newb when the instructor kept telling me to do things to the car and I had no idea what he was talking about.

So now the question is, how best to learn the art of suspension tuning? Well, I started off on Amazon and picked up [Tune to Win: The art and science of race car development and tuning](https://amzn.to/3xVKheZ) by Carroll Smith.

I've yet to crack it open, but I plan to start on it this evening. I'll post more on the website later when I have a feeling for what it actually provides, and can talk about what I am learning (hopefully I'll learn something!)
