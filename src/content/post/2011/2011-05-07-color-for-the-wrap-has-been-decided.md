title: "Color for the wrap has been decided"

A week ago I posted a "question" on Facebook to see what color we should wrap the 350z in. 

Well it looks like the final tally is 31/13/13

-31 for Matte Black
-13 for Matte Green
-13 for Don't Do It!

So Matte Black it will be! Time to order the vinyl! I would hope to have it done by the end of the month, but realizing we are moving before then, we'll set a goal of the end of June to have this completed. Of course we'll have a time lapse video of the process!
