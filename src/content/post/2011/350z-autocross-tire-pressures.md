So with all the blogging I've done over the years I have been unable to find any posts where I mentioned tire pressures!

So here it is, a thread that I will continually update with tire pressure information for my 350z. As I change configurations I will move settings to an archive down below.
## Current Tires
  - Kumho V710 305/30R18 (as of 2/20/2011)

## Current Pressures
- Front: 25psi   
- Rear: 23psi   (as of 2/20/2011, 3/6/2011)
