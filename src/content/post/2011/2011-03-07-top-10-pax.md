So I went to the autocross today, kind of a last minute thing, and boy am I glad I did.

I left the house at 11:30am, got there and changed tires and then ran around 2pm (or after due to a bunch of timing issues).

I was pleased with my runs, my time being faster than a few cars I was sick of being beat by (ST civics!). Though when I went to check the results I was in 6th out of 7 in the Index class I run. I run Index, not in the standard BSP class at SCCA events because I want to compete against the fastest of the fast, no offense to the regular BSP competitors.

6th of 7, eh, at least I wasn't DFL. But then tonight when the [results are posted](https://web.archive.org/web/20120622085634/http://www.sfr-solo.org/solo2/Results/2011/Championship/round04.html) I ended up 10th on the overall index for the event! Woot!

*happy dance*

I believe the first heat of the day had a drying course, and the event overall was smaller (122 drivers) but I'll gladly take a 10th on overall index any day here in the Bay Area!

I'll post videos from the event tomorrow. I would have had three angles, but my original GoPro is such a POS that it didn't get a single recorded video.
