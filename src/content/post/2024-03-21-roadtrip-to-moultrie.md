## #SOLONATSHASSTARTED
Here we go. We are on the road south to Moultrie, Georgia for the 2024 Tire Rack SCCA Red Hills National Tour at Spence Field. I met Dave and Beth at Solo Performance this morning and we hit the road just after 7am, with the plan of getting all the way to Moultrie today, Thursday the 21st. This will be my first time to Moultrie, after having run a few times when the National Tour events were held in Adel, GA. 

All three of us will be driving their 2012 Mustang GT in CAM-C this weekend. I've driven this car many times throughout the years, the last time being at Nationals in 2021. It is the car I got my first trophy at Nationals (5th place), back in 2013 when RTR was a thing (street tire index class before 200 treadware street tire were the rules for Street/Stock classes).

This will be my first National Tour out of town in a while, I am having trouble remembering exactly when, probably 2019? I attended some ProSolo events in that time, but can't think of a Tour that I attended since probably Spring Nationals 2019. 

I am looking forward to running the SPS Mustang in CAM-C this season at as many local and out of town events that I can make work. Scheduling around kids events these days has become more difficult as the kids get older, I am looking forward to them being able to join me at Autocross starting in the next couple of years.

Stay tuned for more updates from Moultrie this weekend and look for some links to photos from the event, assuming I get time to take pictures when not running or working. 

-Chris
