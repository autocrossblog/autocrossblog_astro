I have been scouring the interwebs for a good month or so looking for the perfect FR-S for my SSC build, and came across the one via Autotrader. I reached out to the dealership via Autotrader, and also via TrueCar.com to see what kind of deal I could get on the car. The asking price was $18,499, via the TrueCar inquiry they immediately dropped $125 from the price, though the TrueCar quote was adjusted to include a $598 dealer documentation fee, for a total price of $18,972.

I managed to talk the dealer down about $1k from that price, and after Brian Johns from [Carpartment](https://carpartment.wordpress.com/) stopped by the dealer to check it out for me, I placed a deposit via the phone on Friday night the 9th. Just over a week and a half ago I hitched a ride with Dave from [SoloPerformance.com](https://www.SoloPerformance.com) down to the Dixie Champ Tour in Adel, Georgia. On the way down we stopped in Murfreesboro, Tennessee at Toyota of Murfreesboro to pick up my new SSC ride, a 2016 Scion FR-S.

Because we were on our way down to the Champ Tour, and we wanted to try to swing by the Jack Daniel's Distillery, we were sort of in a rush when we arrived at the dealer with the truck and trailer in tow. I was hoping to get in and out of the dealership in under 2 hours, which, unfortunately, is impossible with car dealers. I performed a quick test drive of the car, and looked her over to see what condition it was in. Overall I was disappointed as I had been told that the car would be detailed before I arrived, but it was far from detailed. It had a rough surface, some sort of film/overspray over most of the car, (top, windows, hood) that was very rough to the touch. It wasn't bad enough that I would change my mind on the car, I figured I would just detail it myself when I had the time and get it cleaned up.

After that, we tried to move forward with the paperwork, I had pre-approval paperwork ready to go from my bank, and even with that it took about 2.5 hours after we arrived before I was back on the road trying to catch up with Dave and his dad who headed off to Lynchburg to take a tour of the distillery.
