It was time to get rid of all the parts I still have taking up space in the garage from the 350z! They're all on ebay (were, ebay links no longer work). 


- SA Koni Sports F/R (used) #150097486225
- 350Evo Front Sway Bar (used) #150097461781
- CT-1 Front Sway Bar (new) #150097477452
- Hotchkis Rear Sway Bar (new) #150097479242


If anyone wants to buy them off ebay, let me know, I'll make a St. Louis deal for folks.
