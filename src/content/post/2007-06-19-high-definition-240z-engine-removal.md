I finally got the video working from my new camera. I installed Windows Vista again last night on my home Machine (after 4 months of running on XP again) and with Vista the camera works great!

You can see/download the video with the URL below. But please right click and save the file, it is large. 180mb, but I think the quality is well worth the wait for the download.

2024 Update: [Uploaded to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk4KsPQu9z4). 180mb large? Lol 2007 me was so funny
