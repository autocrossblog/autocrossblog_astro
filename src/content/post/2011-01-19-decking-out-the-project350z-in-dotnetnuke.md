I don't have an Autocross event coming up for a couple weeks, but I couldn't wait, I had to do something to the car.

So here she is, DotNetNuke logos on the front and the back of the 350z.

**What is DotNetNuke?** DotNetNuke is an open source platform for building web sites based on Microsoft .NET technology

**Why would someone put a DotNetNuke logo on their car?** This website runs on DotNetNuke. My personal website runs on DotNetNuke, my wife's site runs on DotNetNuke, my daughter's website runs on DotNetNuke, SCCAForums.com runs on DotNetNuke. I work for DotNetNuke Corporation. I've used DotNetNuke for 8 years now. My life revolves around DotNetNuke, and has for a long time, and hopefully will for a long time as well.

So I found it fitting that I should try to help promote the product in any way I can. That includes putting the logo on my car, front and back. [I've done it before, on a different car](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2291945232/), so why not on my current car!

So what do you think? Am I crazy?
