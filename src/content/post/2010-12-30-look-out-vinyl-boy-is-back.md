So it has been over 2 years since I've had vinyl on a car, that will be changing in 2011. Look out for the upcoming transformation of the Project 350z! Early in the year I will be doing a minor overhaul, with the goal of doing a full wrap on the car later in the year.

I just need to find someone local who can do the wrap for a reasonable cost, and make sure that they don't damage the car in the process. I've not had anyone apply vinyl to my cars before, I've always done it myself, but I don't have visions of being able to do a full wrap myself.

For a refresher, here are some photos of some of my past vinyl experiences (all self-applied):
