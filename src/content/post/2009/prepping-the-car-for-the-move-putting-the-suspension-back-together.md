Tonight I came home and started putting the suspension back together. Fortunately I hadn't gotten too far with taking it apart, so I didn't have too much to put back together. I decided since we only have a couple of weeks left I won't try getting the other suspension under the car, I'll just worry about getting it together and secured for the trailer ride to Colorado (<going2colorado.com) later this month.

I got the front suspension bits together, though I didn't bother to put the sway bar on for now. I then decided to pull the steering column to get the new one put into the car. That was easy, at least the pulling it out process, I stopped for dinner, but it sure looks like the replacement column isn't going to work :(

I'll have to try to get that in later this week.
