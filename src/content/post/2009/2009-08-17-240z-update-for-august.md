So I didn't actually get anything physically done on the 240Z this weekend, but I did manage to get $40 worth of light bulbs and fuses for the car. 
 I hope to start getting them installed tomorrow night so that I can start testing out the wiring, see what all I am going to have to rewire/fix in order to make the car street legal. Fingers crossed that the stock wiring still works fine!
