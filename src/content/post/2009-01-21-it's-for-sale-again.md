So this time, I think, I am serious about selling the Datsun. With moving sometime in the next 5-6 months I need to start preparing for the move, and with my work/school/book schedule there is no way I will have time to work on the Datsun in the coming months.

I'll post up more info later this week on the sale of the car, but if you're interested let me know. As of right now I will likely have everything I own for the car (minus the Corbeau A4 seats) for sale as a package.

1973 Datsun 240Z

L28E motor
- Megasquirt
- 2 transmissions
- LOTS of other stuff including a spare suspension, hatch, and lots of boxes with parts.

I will try to do a full inventory, or at least a more detailed inventory later on.
