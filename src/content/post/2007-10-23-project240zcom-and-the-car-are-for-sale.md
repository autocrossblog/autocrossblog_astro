With my <a href="https://www.corvettez06.org">recent acquisition</a> I'm going to have to clear out the garage of all of my Datsun parts and cars to make room for a few other vehicles.

I'm going to start putting together information on what all I have for sale, but here's a rough idea.

**1973 Datsun 240Z ** (sans motor)
- Megasquirt Ford EDIS ignition
- Brand New Corbeau A4 seats
  
**1978 280Z 2+2 Motor L28E**
- Ran when removed from parts car, currently needs some parts from the L28ET installed to use the Megasquirt, needs rear main seal replaced.

**(2) 1979 Datsun 5 Speeds**, one needs rebuilt
- 1973 Datsun 240Z Automatic Transmission
  
**1983 280ZX L28ET**
- (#2 piston blew up, head can be repaired and turbo system should be usable) Downpipe and custom exhaust 

Complete second sport suspension for the car, ready to be cleaned up to be powder coated and installed.
  
**New Fuel System**
- 15 Gallon fuel cell
- High Pressure Fuel Pump
- AN hose and fittings front to back
- Custom fuel rail
- Ford Lightning Injectors

**Website**
- Project240Z.com domain name, and 1 year of website hosting, training of use of website. The site gets a lot of traffic from search engine results.
- DVD of the original video files of all the video recordings I have that I used in Project240z.com videos

I'm not sure what all I want to ask for this, it could be a very fun project, with the most expensive parts already purchased and installed.

If you're interested start making me an offer, if I consider it reasonable I'll respond.

Currently not looking to part things out, yet.
