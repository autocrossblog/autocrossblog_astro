Running in BS (B-Stock) for three years, I learned a lot about the 350Z and the setup for the car. While I don't currently still have that car, I will go ahead and create a post about the setup of the car for BS.

**Car:** 2003 Nissan 350Z Enthusiast

**Options:** Aluminum Door plates

**Wheels:** Enkei RP-F1

**Tires:** Hoosier Autocross tires

**Shocks:** Koni Double-adjustable sport shocks (from Nissan Motorsport)

**Configuration:** Empty fuel tank, spare tire, and all carpet removed from rear

**Weight:** ~3075lbs.

**Alignment:**
- Camber
  - FL -0.7 degrees
  - FR -1.2 degrees
  - RL -2.0 degrees
  - RR -2.0 degrees
- Toe
  - FL -0.08 degrees
  - FR -0.10 degrees
  - RL -0.01 degrees
  - RR 0.03 degrees

Some of these values might be off, it has been three years since I owned the car ;) I'm working on trying to get all my old information together about the car.
