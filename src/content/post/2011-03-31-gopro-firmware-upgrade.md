So if you read my postings a month or two ago you know I had trouble with the GoPro firmware last time around. Ended up bricking the camera and having to send it in.

Much better luck tonight! I got V 1.1.5 upgraded without any trouble. I wasn't sure what the camera had on it that they sent me in exchange for my repair, so I wanted to make sure I was on the latest firmware for the trip to San Diego. I'm hoping to timelapse the drive.

We'll see if the batteries (2 of them) last the trip, I doubt it, but we'll see. I have the camera set for shooting every 5 seconds and plan to mount it facing out the windshield.

Thanks for all of you who "like" [Project350z on Facebook](https://facebook.com/project350z)! We've seen some good growth the past couple of days!
