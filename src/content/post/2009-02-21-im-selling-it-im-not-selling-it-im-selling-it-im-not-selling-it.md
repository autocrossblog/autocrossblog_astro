I don't know what I'm doing with the Datsun just yet. I should sell it, but I couldn't sleep the other night because I was thinking about what fun it would be to spend a few weekends in March working on the 240Z.

Well, I don't know if it's a sign or what, but month or two ago when I was trying to put the new motor back together I couldn't find the bag of bolts for the intake and exhaust manifolds. Well guess what I just found today!

Now, I just need to get my book done, and hire my good buddy Terec for a weekend to help me get the motor back together and in the car. I find that if someone is here helping me on the car I get 10x the amount of work done as if I am by myself. So, Terec, what do you think, first or second weekend in March good? If we got it running on 3/15 that would be awesome, as that's my bday :D

Happy Belated Bday to Terec as well, 2/18.

So, am I selling the car? I don't know. I want to buy another 350Z, but it would make a lot more sense to not do that and try to get this datsun running.
