So the car is naked, well about as naked as it can be.

Saturday evening I took it to the car wash and removed all of the vinyl. I plan to put it back on, but it'll be a while before that happens. I figured it was a little too much right now to attract attention. I'd post photos, but there really isn't much point, right now the car is just a blue 350z that is a little lower than normal.
