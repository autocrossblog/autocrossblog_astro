Tonight I told myself I wouldn't start the car, I would get ready for my trip to Chicago tomorrow (going up there to give two days of DotNetNuke training classes).

But I couldn't help myself, I had to get the camera and record the new exhaust! It's not quiet, but oh it sounds so sweet!

[Here's a 2mb WAV file of the car running](https://www.project240z.com/P240z-8-6.wav)
