I spent a bit of time this evening working on the 280Z. 

Here's what I got done.

    - Drained the oil
    - Drained the transmission fluid
    - Removed the hood wings
    - Removed the driver's side mirror
    - Removed teh driver's side Z vent cover
                 
Tomorrow: The motor and transmission come out.
