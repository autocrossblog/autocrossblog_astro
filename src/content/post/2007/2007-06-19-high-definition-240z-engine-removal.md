I came out to the garage an hour ago. The motor is once again removed from the 240Z. 

HD video with my new video camera is posted below!

I finally got the video working from my new camera. I installed Windows Vista again last night on my home Machine (after 4 months of running on XP again) and with Vista the camera works great!

You can see/download the video with the URL below. But please right click and save the file, it is large. 180mb, but I think the quality is well worth the wait for the download.
