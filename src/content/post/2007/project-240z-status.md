Current status: On hold

Why? Mainly school. It's nearing the end of the semester and I'm trying to get some class work finished up. I have a large presentation on Monday evening, after that, Tuesday, I hope to start back up on the car.

I'm picking up a replacement 240Z Gas tank on Sunday, instead of going with a fuel cell for now I'm hoping to get by with a stock 240Z tank.

I ordered a Flux/Gas welder from Harbor Freight on Thursday. It's cheap, but will hopefully at least get me started. I can see how well I can learn, and hopefully repair/build a few things along the way. If I start to use it much (I don't foresee this) I'll look at getting a nicer model sometime.

I started putting my new workbench together last night. I'll take some pics of it once it's finished (must install the tabletop still) and moved around in the garage. Right now it's in front of the car as I haven't made room for it on the wall yet.

More next week!
