Well, tomorrow night I'm hitting the road. Actually a buddy of mine Kevin and I are renting Harleys for Friday night/Saturday. We'll be heading out tomorrow afternoon towards Chester on IL-3, coming back up the MO after a seafood buffet stop down there.

Saturday morning we're going to meet up again and cruise up the riverroad to who knows where. If you've got a bike and want to join us, let me know.
