title: "Monday night update"

After heading to class this evening I headed off to Sears to pickup a few things for the garage. I picked up a shop vac to assist in cleaning out the interior of the car, and all the rust I plan to clean out of the floorboard. I also picked up a nice portable Vice to go on my new workbench I picked up tonight.

I was going to post a link to each of the items I purchased tonight, [but I ran into an issue with Sears.com. I must tell you, Sears.com sucks](https://www.themadblogger.com/Searscom-heres-a-tip)!
