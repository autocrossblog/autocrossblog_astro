I was digging through some old photos tonight looking for photos of <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/475212637/">Jeff Krekeler</A>, when I ran across this photo I took back in June of 2004.

When I get bored, lazy, or tired of working on the Project240z, I only have to look at that photo and realize what I'm striving for. That car is beautiful, and I hope my car can one day look that good...
