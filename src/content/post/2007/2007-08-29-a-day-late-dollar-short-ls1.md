Well, I was excited when I got up this morning. I thought i was going to go look at a LS1 motor for the 240z... But as of a few minutes ago I think the motor won't be there when I go to look at lunch today.

We'll see, I may luck out and it may not be sold yet, but I was informed someone was coming to pick it up already. If not, if it looks good, I'll probably be purchasing the next powerplant for the Project240z today.

Last night I spent some time in the garage, trying to clean up and get parts ready for an ebay explosion. More on the ebay parts later this week.
