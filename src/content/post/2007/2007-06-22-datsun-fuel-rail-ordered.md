I just got off the phone with lonewolfperformance.com and ordered my fuel rail for the Project 240Z. Hopefully it will be here next week. Tomorrow I'll get on ordering the other parts I need, a guage, regulator and some fittings. As well as starting to locate some injectors!

Thanks for James at Lonewolf for all the help on the phone today, he was great with answering my questions, and guess where they're from? Salina Kansas of all places, I guess I'll have to get the car ready and make it to an event in Salina sometime next year!
