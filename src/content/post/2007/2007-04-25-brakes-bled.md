title: "Brakes bled"

Dad and I spent a few hours this evening working on the brakes on the 240Z. You have to be able to stop before you even start on the motor right? That's what I keep telling myself, though they brakes still need a lot of work! We did get the new (rebuilt) master cylinder installed, and bled, and apply braking force on the discs/drums!

We ended up with a hodgepodge of brake/clutch systems. The vacuum boost is from the 73 240z, the master cylinder is a rebuilt cylinder for a 78 280Z, the clutch is from a 78 280z as the 73 240z was originaly an auto.

Catch all that? Both systems are bled and semi ready. The brakes need to be pulled off the car, probably get the discs turned next week, and see what I need to do with the rear drums/shoes. Eventually I'd like to go to a 4 wheel disc setup, but that will have to wait until I have the cash to do a full suspension setup, most likely a setup from www.arizonazcar.com.

Not much else accomplished on the car tonight, hoping to get the garage a bit organized on Thursday and start shooting video again, it's been too long since I did a time lapse.
