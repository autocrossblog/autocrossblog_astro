I took the gas tank out of the 240Z down to Manchester Radiator on Wednesday. They called me on Thursday to tell me that the tank was in a sad state. They dipped it and cleaned it up to find a lot of pinholes and larger holes in the bottom of the tank from rust. Rather than repair it they asked me if I could get another one from somewhere.

Lucky for me SM2 allows for Fuel Cells, now I just need to read up on the rules and figure out where I can mount one legally in my car, and figure out how much that is going to end up costing me.

The car hasn't been touched since last Sunday, and won't see any action before at least Thursday as Natalie and I are headed to Boston tomorrow for Opening Day on Tuesday.
