This just in, there may still be life in the Project240z.... It might get saved from the grasp of Ebay and become just a toy/project/wrench on me when you can car. Not a daily driver, not a race car, just something to play with, work on, add to, without worry of "will it make it faster or slower"

More information coming sometime, who knows when!
