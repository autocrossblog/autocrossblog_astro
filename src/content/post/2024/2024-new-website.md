Welcome to the all-new **AutocrossBlog.com**! ðŸŽ‰ After a year of running the site on Jekyll, weâ€™ve rebuilt it from the ground up using the blazing-fast framework **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**. This move not only makes the site faster and easier to maintain but also sets us up to deliver even better content for the autocross community.

### **Excitement for 2025**

As we turn the page to the 2025 season, thereâ€™s so much to look forward to! Expect **event coverage**, **driver insights**, and **behind-the-scenes prep** for what promises to be an unforgettable year in autocross. Whether you're a seasoned driver or a curious newcomer, weâ€™re committed to bringing you closer to the action.

### **Our New Ride: The 2016 Scion FR-S (SSC Prepped)**

One of the most exciting changes for 2025 is our **new ride**: a 2016 Scion FR-S, prepped for the **Solo Spec Coupe (SSC)** class. This car represents everything we love about autocrossâ€”a tightly contested class with evenly matched cars, where the driver makes the difference. With its balanced chassis, precision handling, and dedicated SSC modifications, this FR-S is ready to tear up the cones.

Weâ€™re already diving into prep work and testing, fine-tuning everything from alignment to driving techniques to ensure weâ€™re competitive from the start. Stay tuned for updates, photos, and videos as we push this car to its limits in the upcoming season.

### **A Fresh Start for AutocrossBlog.com**

Switching to Astro has given us a chance to reimagine the site. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new:
- **Faster Load Times**: The site is optimized for speed and performance, perfect for viewing on the go.
- **Enhanced Photo Galleries**: Featuring high-resolution images from events and action shots of drivers.
- **Streamlined Content**: Easier navigation so you can quickly find event coverage, car builds, and helpful tips.
- **Interactive Features**: New tools and resources for autocross enthusiasts are in the worksâ€”stay tuned!

### **Join Us on This Journey**

Weâ€™re thrilled about whatâ€™s ahead and canâ€™t wait to share the journey with you. The 2025 season is shaping up to be our most exciting yet, and weâ€™re honored to have you along for the ride. If youâ€™re as pumped about autocross and SSC competition as we are, make sure to follow along, leave a comment, or share your own autocross story.

Letâ€™s make 2025 a season to remember!


See you on the course,  
**The AutocrossBlog.com Team**
