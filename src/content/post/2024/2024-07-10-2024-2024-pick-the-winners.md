You may have noticed a link in our main navigation to AutocrossRank.com, that's our sister site! Another project from Chris Hammond!

We've got big visions for the project, but for now we've launched it with a reincarnation of the Pick The Winners contest that we used to run over on SCCAForums.com. This year's contest is the [2024 SPS Pick The Winners Contest](https://www.autocrossrank.com/pick-the-winners/2024-solo-nationals)!

A big thank you to [Solo Performance Specialties](https://www.soloperformance.com/) for stepping up and providing a price for the contest! 

## What is the Pick The Winners Contest?
The contest is pretty simple, see who can pick the most correct winners of classes at the 2024 Tire Rack SCCA Solo National Championships in September. The goal is to have more winners chosen than anyone else who votes. There is a tiebreaker defined in the rules which you can [check out on the page](https://www.autocrossrank.com/pick-the-winners/2024-solo-nationals).

## Pick The Winners Contest History

It was originally started by Josh Sirota long ago, I took it over from him when I was helping run SCCAForums.com for Dave Schotz. As we retired that website in favor of most conversation happening on Facebook groups these days the contest kind of fell by the way side. 

## How to win?
Do you research, pick who you think will actually win each class at Nationals. Be sure to update your votes right before the deadline, the Monday before Nationals starts on Tuesday, so that you get access to any last minute class changes!
