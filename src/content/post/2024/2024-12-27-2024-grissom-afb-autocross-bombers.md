For autocross enthusiasts, finding the right venue can make all the difference.  Smooth pavement, challenging layouts, and a bit of history? Even better!  That's exactly what drivers get when they compete at Grissom Air Reserve Base in Bunker Hill, Indiana.  But this isn't your average parking lot. This asphalt holds a story that takes us back to the Cold War.

During those tense years, Grissom ARB (then Grissom Air Force Base) was a vital strategic location.  The base was home to a squadron of KC-135 Stratotankers, aerial refueling aircraft ready to support bombers and fighters at a moment's notice.  To ensure rapid response, these tankers were parked in a specific configuration known as a "Christmas tree" or "alert parking area." This allowed crews to quickly scramble to their aircraft and get airborne, minimizing precious seconds in a potential conflict.

Today, the threat of immediate nuclear war has subsided (eh, maybe?), and those alert areas have found a new purpose.  Instead of the roar of jet engines, the "Christmas tree" now echoes with the squeal of tires and the cheers of autocrossers.  Organizations like the SCCA regularly host events on this historic ground, giving drivers a unique and exciting place to test their skills.

Imagine weaving through cones where Cold War aircrews once raced against time.  It's a thrilling experience that connects the passion of motorsports with a tangible piece of history.  

**Why Grissom is a Great Autocross Venue:**

* **Wide Open Space:** The former alert area provides ample room for creating challenging courses with a variety of layouts.
* **Smooth Surface:**  The well-maintained tarmac offers excellent grip and predictable handling.
* **Historical Significance:**  Competing on grounds that once played a crucial role in national defense adds a special dimension to the event.

**If you're an autocrosser looking for a unique and exciting venue, be sure to check out the events at Grissom Air Reserve Base.  You'll not only get your adrenaline pumping but also experience a piece of living history.**

I ran my first autocross at Grissom in the year 2000, the first year I autocrossed. I lived on Grissom AFB for just about a year, back in 92-93 when my father was stationed there before it was converted to a reserve base. I love getting back to Indiana to compete on this site!
