### **Our New Ride: The 2016 Scion FR-S (SSC Prepped)**

One of the most exciting changes for 2025 is our **new ride**: a 2016 Scion FR-S, prepped for the **Solo Spec Coupe (SSC)** class. This car represents everything we love about autocrossâ€”a tightly contested class with evenly matched cars, where the driver makes the difference. With its balanced chassis, precision handling, and dedicated SSC modifications, this FR-S is ready to tear up the cones.

Weâ€™re already diving into prep work and testing, fine-tuning everything from alignment to driving techniques to ensure weâ€™re competitive from the start. Stay tuned for updates, photos, and videos as we push this car to its limits in the upcoming season.
