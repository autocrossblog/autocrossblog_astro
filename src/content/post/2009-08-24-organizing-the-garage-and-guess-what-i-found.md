So we've barely been in the house three weeks and I already lost and found something! <a href="/out-goes-the-dash">So in my last blog post I complained</a> that I thought I left the fiberglass dashboard for the 240Z in St. Louis. Well I was wrong! Tonight while trying to get things moved around in the garage to make room for our two primary vehicles I was up on the loft moving things and came across the dashboard!

So all is well again in Project240z.com land, well, as well as it can be! I was going to drive the car around the block tonight, and park it in the third car garage, but I quickly realized that wasn't going to happen unless I wanted to take the wiring harness out of the old dash and hook up the wires. Right now the ignition wires aren't going to anything, so that would make it kind of hard to start the car and drive it. Oh well, I moved it around a bit by hand and made room for one of our cars in the garage at least, the F350 will have to stay outside for a while longer.

Hopefully by the end of September I'll either have a new quieter exhaust on the car, or all the paint completely stripped off, or maybe even both!
