So I seriously think I have spent more money on tools than I have spent on the car or parts for the car!

I bought more stuff at Sears tonight, also went to the Metal Supermarket and picked up some metal to work on the car this weekend. I'm hoping to tow the car down to Dave's on Sunday to get some welding done as I have yet to purchase a welder.

Tomorrow I'm heading south to look at a trailer, pictures tomorrow if it comes home with me.

Before I ran off and spent too much money this evening I took the front rotors off the spare suspension, took them to Carquest to have them turned and I'll pick them up tomorrow afternoon after looking at the trailer.
