I spent some time this evening working on the interior of the car again. I went through one wire wheel and halfway through another on the passenger side of the car tonight.

Tomorrow I'll be doing some final prep work, possibly laying some fiberglass (for the first time) and then later this week painting the floor.

Photos and more later this week!
