title: "Cherry 240Z in Manchester Tennessee"

So I'm stopped in Manchester Tennessee tonight on my way home and to Lynchburg tomorrow. I went out to check on the car out in the parking lot and saw a 240Z parked out there in tow behind a frontier. The car looks cherry, orange, straight and without a single spot of rust from what I can tell. I took a photo, once all my Atlanta National Tour photos finish uploading I will post the photo I took with my cell phone.

I hope to get working on my car again very soon, in the next week.
