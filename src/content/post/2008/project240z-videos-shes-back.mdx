So it has been a while since I've posted any Project240Z videos, too long in fact. Well here are two, one that i failed to post back in March, and one that I just made today!

## March 2008

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="TfeIKACQKSg" title="P240Z Starting on the new Motor" publishDate="2008-03-11T23:31:43+00:00" description="Started on the new L28E motor for the 240Z. I had problems with the video for this, thus the small window of video. I may try to redo this later in the week." />

## 8/9/2008

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="h-Fg35IDrNs" title="Project240Z.com Garage Cleanup The Return" publishDate="2008-08-09T23:31:43+00:00" description="It has been a almost a year (2 days shy?) since the motor went in the 240Z. It has been in storage most of that time and today is the day it came home. I had to make room in the garage before I could get it in though." />
