What? Chris actually worked on the 240Z? Impossible! It tis true, it really is. Tonight I got home and decided it was time to tear into the motor, so I did just that. I even recorded the whole process, so hopefully I'll have video up soon. For now you can check out the photos of what I found, be warned, it's not pretty!

Here's the first one, this is NOT ALL of the parts, there are still parts in the motor that may never come out.

At first I thought I found a nut, and that was the culprit of the whole mess. I don't believe that to be the case, I believe the nuts/bolts connecting the rod to the crankshaft came free, though, perhaps that was the problem, maybe they were lose?

I'm going to save this piece, and perhaps attach it to my office door at work.
