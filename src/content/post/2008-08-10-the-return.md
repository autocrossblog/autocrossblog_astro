The car is finally back home, within reach of me actually working on it and hopefully getting it running in the next few weeks.

[I've posted two videos, you can find them on this page](/project240z-videos-she-s-back)

[I've also posted some photos to flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157594465585463/)
