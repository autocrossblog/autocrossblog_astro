Welcome to my autocross handbook/manual. Here I am working on putting together a complete guide on getting started in autocross along with some tips and tricks that will hopefully help you along the way to many years of great competition in the sport. 

This is a work in progress, if you have any feedback [reach out](/contact) and let me know! -Chris Hammond

## 1. Introduction to Autocross

### What is Autocross?
Autocross is a timed competition where drivers navigate a defined course on a paved surface, typically a large parking lot or airfield, using traffic cones. It’s a sport that emphasizes car control and precision over outright speed. Cars are classes based on a variety of characteristics and modification levels. This classing tries to level the playing field so that an old Yugo isn't competing against a brand new C8 Corvette.

Cars run individually on a course, against the clock, not door to door against other drivers, though for efficiency sake often times multiple cars will be on course together, they typically started 15-25 seconds apart to create a safety gap.

Courses are "staffed" by competitors. One of the key tenants of autocross is that the competitors also work the event, helping out to provide key services necessary to host an event. Most people will spend time working the course, chasing down and replacing cones that are knocked over or moved out of their "box" that marks their position on the course.

When competing, hitting a cone will typically cause you a 2-second time penalty, adding time to your run. Cones are marked by chalked (sometimes paint) boxes, if the cones remains upright and touching some part of the box, hitting it does not cause a penalty. If the cones is knocked over, or moved outside of the box, it is counted for a penalty.


### Why Participate?
- Affordable way to experience motorsport - you can compete in just about (there are some limitations) any car that you already own. 
- Improves driving skills and car control.
- A welcoming and supportive community - you'll find all sorts of individuals and groups autocrossing. Often times they are like minded individuals who want to improve their driving and get more competitive in the sport. 
- Competition - people enjoy competing, some people really thrive in a motorsports competition where they can rapidly improve their skills with practice.

### What are the courses like?
- Almost every autocross you compete in will be a different course layout.
- Courses are marked by orange traffic cones with a variety of different configurations in order to control the flow/direction of the course.
- Some courses will be small and tight, often times constrained by the size of the lot/surface available for use. Other courses will be large and spacious with room to really get on the throttle of your vehicle.


## 2. Getting Started

### When is Autocross Season
- This will vary greatly by the part of the country (climate) you are in. Here in the midwest, the season typically runs from March until mid-October. In Arizona, Florida and parts of California, you'll often find clubs that run year round.

### Finding Local Events
- Check local car clubs or national organizations like the [SCCA - Sports Car Club of America](https://www.scca.com/).
- Search for events on social media or motorsport forums - nowadays most groups have moved online to Facebook groups, you might search for a local group there.

### Necessary Equipment
- A car in good mechanical condition - Do the brakes work well? Are the wheel bearings nice and tight? Do you have all your lug nuts? Is the battery nice and secure?
- A helmet (check local event requirements for specifications) - most of the time you need a helmet that has a Snell rating of 2010 or greater (2010, 2015, 2020 are currently legal for SCCA competition). 
- Comfortable clothes and shoes suitable for driving - with this sport you aren't required to have fire resistant clothing as might be required with other motorsports competition.
- Do you still have seat belts, use them. Many people will use additional harnesses (even as simple as just an additional canvas chest strap) to help keep you secure in the vehicle. The less effort you are exerting trying to keep yourself in place, the more effort you can focus on your driving.

### Registration and Costs
- Register online or at the event - This will vary by region, a lot of regions allow (some require) pre-registration via [MotorsportsReg.com](https://www.motorsportsreg.com)
- Typical entry fees range from $40 to $60 - Again this will vary by region. 
- Some regions will require you to be a club member, most often times for insurance reasons. Typically there are temporary membership options available when required.



## 3. Event Day Basics

### What to Expect at Your First Event
- Arrive early to allow time for check-in and setup. How early? I would suggest 90 minutes or more before they say the first car will run. This will give you time to get a lay of the land and understand all the things you need to do before you compete.
- Meet other participants and ask questions! 
- When you pull in to an event site you will most likely be asked to sign a waiver, this provides a little acknowledgement and coverage for insurance purposes for the organization hosting the event. If you are under 18, or have dependents who are under 18 you'll likely need to go through a process of filling out a minor waiver of some form.
- When you get onsite ask the waiver person(s) where you need to go next, let htem know this is your first time and they will likely help get you pointed in the right direction.

### Check-in and Tech Inspection Process
- Show your driver’s license, pay if necessary. 
- Get your work assignment, many regions will assign you a work assignment when you check in to registration. Ask for help at this point if you are unsure what you need to be doing.
- Following registration you will typically go through "tech" inspection. You will have your car inspected for safety (e.g., belts, brakes, battery, loose items). It is always the vehicle owner/driver's responsibility to ensure they have a safe vehicle, tech inspection is a quick check over some basic items. Many regions will offer an annual tech inspection for regular competitors, meaning you can avoid the tech inspection process at future events. 

### Course Walk
- Most clubs will allow you to walk the course before you run the event, those that don't might give you a "parade" lap in which you drive around the course at a slow pace to get a preview.
- Walk the course at least once to familiarize yourself - Many people will walk the course multiples times, 2, 3, even 10 to 12 times at a National level event where you can walk the course before hand.
- If the club allows it, and you can find someone to let you do it, ride along with other drivers. This is a great way to see the course at speed and to see how different drivers take different approaches to a course.
- Look ahead while walking the course, try to plan your line through the cones.


## 4. Driving Techniques

### Basic Car Control
- Smooth inputs on the steering wheel, throttle, and brakes.
- Maintain balance by avoiding abrupt movements.

### Navigating Cones and Turns
- Aim for a late apex to maximize exit speed.
- Follow the shortest, cleanest line through the course.

### Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- Overdriving: Stay smooth and controlled.
- Cone penalties: Focus on precision rather than speed.



## 5. Classes and Categories

### Overview of Car Classifications
- Stock: Minimal modifications allowed.
- Modified: Extensive modifications permitted.
- Street Prepared, Street Touring, etc.: Intermediate levels of modification.

### Understanding PAX/Index
- A handicap system to level the playing field across classes - This is often times used by the fastest drivers to compare themselves to other fast drivers. 
- Allows drivers to compare times regardless of vehicle type.
- Also referred to as Calculator racing.



## 6. Course Info

### How are courses marked?
- Courses are laid out using orange traffic cones to define boundaries and control direction.
- Cones are placed in specific configurations to create challenges like slaloms, sharp turns, and straightaways.
- Some cones may have pointer cones next to them to indicate the intended direction of travel.
- Corner workers are stationed to reset cones if they are knocked over during a run.

### Cone Penalties
- Hitting a cone usually results in a time penalty (1-2 seconds per cone, depending on the club).
- Missing a gate or navigating the course incorrectly results in a DNF (Did Not Finish).



## 7. Improving Your Skills

### Tips for Practice and Improvement
- Attend practice events and fun runs.
- Experiment with different techniques and learn from mistakes.
- Don't worry about modifying your car right away, you can pick up many seconds, sometimes 10+, just by learning the limits of your car and pushing/improving your driving. 

### Resources
- Books: "Speed Secrets" by Ross Bentley.
- Videos: YouTube channels like "SoloStorm" or "The Cone Coach."
- Instructors: Attend a driving school or seek advice from experienced drivers.



## 8. Glossary of Terms
- **Apex:** The inside point of a turn.
- **PAX:** Performance Adjustment Index.
- **DNF:** Did Not Finish.
- **Slalom:** A series of cones set up in a straight line requiring weaving through them.
- **Chicago Box:**
- **Pylon:**
- **DNS:**
- **+1:**



## 9. FAQs

### Do I need a special car to start?
No! Any car in safe, running condition can compete. Rules may vary by where you run, cars with too high a center of gravity may not be considered safe.

### What class does my car run in?
That question is one that can take a while to answer. We will build out some details here on the Handbook on how to figure out what class your car runs in, it might be multiple!

### How many runs do I get?
Typically, 3 to 6 runs per event depending on the organizer. Often times the number of runs provided will vary, based on the number of entrants, the time of year (amount of daylight), and even how smoothly things are running for the event. At National autocross competitions you will very rarely get more than 3 runs (3 each day for a multi-day event).

### What happens if I hit a cone?
Each cone hit adds a time penalty (usually 2 seconds, though some clubs use a 1 second penalty).

### What do you win in autocross?
Trophies may be available with different organizations for some events. At a National level with SCCA you can often times win contingency money, where a manufacturer of a vehicle or tire provides prize money or other incentives. 

### What is ProSolo?
ProSolo is a unique style of autocross that combines drag racing and traditional autocross. Two cars start side-by-side on mirror-image courses, launching from a drag-style Christmas tree. Drivers race against the clock, and the best times from each course are combined to determine the winner. The head-to-head aspect adds excitement and a different challenge to the sport. There is also typically a bracket competition at the end of the event in which cars from different classes are released at different times, based on their ProSolo Index.
