## 1. Introduction to Autocross

### What is Autocross?
Autocross is a timed competition where drivers navigate a defined course on a paved surface, typically a large parking lot or airfield, using traffic cones. It’s a sport that emphasizes car control and precision over outright speed. Cars are classes based on a variety of characteristics and modification levels. This classing tries to level the playing field so that an old Yugo isn't competing against a brand new C8 Corvette.

### Why Participate?
- Affordable way to experience motorsport - you can compete in just about (there are some limitations) any car that you already own. 
- Improves driving skills and car control.
- A welcoming and supportive community - you'll find all sorts of individuals and groups autocrossing. Often times they are like minded individuals who want to improve their driving and get more competitive in the sport. 

## 2. Getting Started

### Finding Local Events
- Check local car clubs or national organizations like the [SCCA - Sports Car Club of America](https://www.scca.com/).
- Search for events on social media or motorsport forums - nowadays most groups have moved online to Facebook groups, you might search for a local group there.

### Necessary Equipment
- A car in good mechanical condition - Do the brakes work well? Are the wheel bearings nice and tight? Do you have all your lug nuts? Is the battery nice and secure?
- A helmet (check local event requirements for specifications) - most of the time you need a helmet that has a Snell rating of 2010 or greater (2010, 2015, 2020 are currently legal for SCCA competition). 
- Comfortable clothes and shoes suitable for driving - with this sport you aren't required to have fire resistant clothing as might be required with other motorsports competition.

### Registration and Costs
- Register online or at the event - This will vary by region, a lot of regions allow (some require) pre-registration via [MotorsportsReg.com](https://www.motorsportsreg.com)
- Typical entry fees range from $40 to $60 - Again this will vary by region. 



## 3. Event Day Basics

### What to Expect at Your First Event
- Arrive early to allow time for check-in and setup.
- Meet other participants and ask questions.

### Check-in and Tech Inspection Process
- Show your driver’s license and sign a waiver.
- Have your car inspected for safety (e.g., brakes, battery, loose items).

### Walkthrough and Course Map Tips
- Walk the course at least once to familiarize yourself.
- Look ahead while driving to plan your line through the cones.



## 4. Driving Techniques

### Basic Car Control
- Smooth inputs on the steering wheel, throttle, and brakes.
- Maintain balance by avoiding abrupt movements.

### Navigating Cones and Turns
- Aim for a late apex to maximize exit speed.
- Follow the shortest, cleanest line through the course.

### Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
- Overdriving: Stay smooth and controlled.
- Cone penalties: Focus on precision rather than speed.



## 5. Classes and Categories

### Overview of Car Classifications
- Stock: Minimal modifications allowed.
- Modified: Extensive modifications permitted.
- Street Prepared, Street Touring, etc.: Intermediate levels of modification.

### Understanding PAX/Index
- A handicap system to level the playing field across classes - This is often times used by the fastest drivers to compare themselves to other fast drivers. 
- Allows drivers to compare times regardless of vehicle type.
- Also referred to as Calculator racing.



## 6. Improving Your Skills

### Tips for Practice and Improvement
- Attend practice events and fun runs.
- Experiment with different techniques and learn from mistakes.
- Don't worry about modifying your car right away, you can pick up many seconds, sometimes 10+, just by learning the limits of your car and pushing/improving your driving. 

### Resources
- Books: "Speed Secrets" by Ross Bentley.
- Videos: YouTube channels like "SoloStorm" or "The Cone Coach."
- Instructors: Attend a driving school or seek advice from experienced drivers.



## 7. Glossary of Terms
- **Apex:** The inside point of a turn.
- **PAX:** Performance Adjustment Index.
- **DNF:** Did Not Finish.
- **Slalom:** A series of cones set up in a straight line requiring weaving through them.



## 8. FAQs

### Do I need a special car to start?
No! Any car in safe, running condition can compete. Rules may vary by where you run, cars with too high a center of gravity may not be considered safe.

### How many runs do I get?
Typically, 3 to 6 runs per event depending on the organizer. Often times the number of runs provided will vary, based on the number of entrants, the time of year (amount of daylight), and even how smoothly things are running for the event. At National autocross competitions you will very rarely get more than 3 runs (3 each day for a multi-day event).

### What happens if I hit a cone?
Each cone hit adds a time penalty (usually 2 seconds, though some clubs use a 1 second penalty).

### What do you win in autocross?
Trophies may be available with different organizations for some events. At a National level with SCCA you can often times win contingency money, where a manufacturer of a vehicle or tire provides prize money or other incentives. 

### What is ProSolo?
ProSolo is a unique style of autocross that combines drag racing and traditional autocross. Two cars start side-by-side on mirror-image courses, launching from a drag-style Christmas tree. Drivers race against the clock, and the best times from each course are combined to determine the winner. The head-to-head aspect adds excitement and a different challenge to the sport. There is also typically a bracket competition at the end of the event in which cars from different classes are released at different times, based on their ProSolo Index.
